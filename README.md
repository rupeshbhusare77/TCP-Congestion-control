# Project Overview: TCP Congestion Control

Welcome to our Computer Networks (CS212) team project on "TCP Congestion Control." Our team, consisting of Devyani Rumalkar, Maryada Harshini, Sai Prasanna, and myself, explored innovative solutions to TCP congestion control through various simulations.

## Highlights

- **Award-Winning Project:** We won the "Best Team Project Award" and prize money, presented by our course inspector, Neha Karanjakar.
- **Invaluable Guidance:** Neha ma'am's lab assignments were instrumental in our success.
- **Exploring Alternatives:** We analyzed multiple alternatives for congestion control using mathematical expressions and simulations.

## Project Details

Our project addressed key questions about TCP congestion control methods, their alternatives, and their performance under different conditions. We provided answers through detailed analysis and simulations.

Feel free to explore our repository for more information on our findings and contributions. We hope our work is a valuable resource for those interested in network congestion control.
